# EaglerCraft Client Selector

A website that hosts and provides many modified EaglerCraft Clients with a clean UI
Thanks to Robert Dixon for his HTML Link Page Template (https://github.com/robsd/html-link-page/tree/main)

Clients Included:

Markup :  Pi Client
Markup :  OddFuture Client
Markup :  Nebula Client
Markup :  NitClient
Markup :  DragonX V2
Markup :  N0VA Client
Markup :  Kerosene Client
Markup :  Solar Client
Markup :  Precision Client

Also thanks to TechGeekUnited for Archiving the client files (https://github.com/TechGeekUnited/TGU-Archive)

I will most likely not update the clients themselfs unless the clients stop working
