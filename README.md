# EaglerCraft Client Selector

A website that hosts and provides many modified EaglerCraft Clients with a clean UI
Thanks to Robert Dixon for his HTML Link Page Template (https://github.com/robsd/html-link-page/tree/main)

Clients Included

Pi Client
OddFuture Client
Nebula Client
NitClient
DragonX V2
N0VA Client
Kerosene Client
Solar Client
Precision Client

Also thanks to TechGeekUnited for Archiving the client files (https://github.com/TechGeekUnited/TGU-Archive)

I will most likely not update the clients themselfs unless the clients stop working
